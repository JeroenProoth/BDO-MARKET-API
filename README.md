## About The Project

Thanks to :sparkles:[Ruwann](https://github.com/Ruwann):sparkles: for helping me figure out how to read the Google console.

I tried to build a Python library to communicate with the Black Desert Online marketplace.

## Getting Started

Obtaining API credentials is analogous to the explanation provided by [kookehs](https://github.com/kookehs/bdo-marketplace#obtaining-credentials-for-api-calls). However, I used an external tool called [curlconverter](https://curl.trillworks.com/) to convert the cURL to a Python script and worked from there.
I will sort-off copy-paste it here for convencience.


0. `User-Agent` is already spoofed within the library. No need for you to do this.
1. Sign in to https://market.blackdesertonline.com/.
2. Open the `Developer Tools` and select `Network`.
3. Click the search icon. Search for an item with enhancement. 
4. Click on the listing to open up details for that item.
5. Check the network tab for `GetItemSellBuyInfo`. 
	- Create a file `secrets.py` with parameters `SESSIONID`, `COOKIETOKEN` and `FORMTOKEN`. An example can be found [here]5https://github.com/JeroenProoth/BDO-MARKET-API/blob/main/examples/secrets_example.pyÂ°.
	- Right-click and select `cURL (cmd)`
	- Paste into [curlconverter](https://curl.trillworks.com/] and convert to Python).
		- `SESSIONID` can be found under `cookies`, and is called `ASP.NET_SessionId`
		- `COOKIETOKEN` can be found under `cookies` and is called `__RequestVerificationToken`
		- `FORMTOKEN` can be found under `headers` and is called `__RequestVerificationToken`
